change c ants_masking

1 using unmasked images and combined mask as fixed and moving image mask 
(for fixed:linearly transformed combined mask)
-> this makes the transformation stretch out less to the edges (at least in all directions but phase encoding
-> but it seems a bit deformed, the deformation seems to be where the anatomical has a white 'hole' 
-> in fact, it seems to go

2 same but with sampling percentage increased from 0.3 - 1.0
-> this doesn't change a thing compared to 1!

3 invert unmasked image and use both unmasked images for nonlinear
-> of course, this doesn't change too much... 
-> gaps in the brain image seem to be a problem, as they are zero before, they have very high values afterwards
-> actually the masking in ants might be slightly better...?

4 keeping changes but trying drastically more iterations (not more levels though for now) as with masking
pulling to the edges seems to be less extreme
-> looks pretty good, the only difference on the first glance being, that the epi is stretched more to the front
but less to the back. whyever
-> the cc and the veins match better. for some weird reason this doesn't go that much overboard
-> jay! enough for the day
-> BUT: ventral OFC maybe less improved? (change restrictions?)

tomorrow: dilation, inversion, restriction

5 changing dilation to 1
-> worse, only little improvement against nonlinear
-> weird because the mask actually seems good enough

6 changing dilation to 2
-> in between dilation 2 and 3

7 no masking whatsoever
-> totally not

8 changing dilation back to 3 for now, setting sampling strategy to None, moving on to inversion
-> as expected just like c4

#########################################################

change d inversion
1 change inversion to robust min/max for epi (not for anat though)
-> inv anatomical looks better like this, keep the change, but for the nonlinear it doesn't change a thing
+++++++++ problem, that i didn't see in ants_masking: stretching out to the back+++++++++++++++++++++

2 skip inversion completely
-> this is interesting, it does exactly what it is supposed to do, pushing out to the front, in at the back, just maybe not right enough
-> no actually in the other brains it is too much of the squeezing in at the back

3 recip instead of inversion
-> weird in the back, stretches out to the 0 areas?

4 use ribbon mask dil 1 before recip to avoid 'holes'
-> looks pretty good, compared to c8 it spreads more to the borders again (as no masking in ants)
-> but using dil1 that doesn't seem too much of a problem
-> though: does it maybe stretch out too much to the back? and in dorso-ventral directions?
-> still not happy with this border stretching
-> since epi wasn't masked cerebellum/brain stem screwed up

5 same with masking epi within ants (with the small dil1 mask)
-> doesn't change a thing

6 same with masking both in ants
-> no, this ants masking doesn't really seem to work after all. at least not with the dil1 mask
-> it stops after fewer interations and gives out a weird squiggled thing

7 like 6 but ants mask dil3 (t1 mask dil1 though)
-> no, this is too big. it is no good to use this big mask

8 like 4 but also masking epi before again
-> looks better, but this again seems to do a bit too much stretching, both a-p and d-v
-> actually has stopped iterating itself (good)

9 like 8 but with restricting def to y direction
-> no no
-> reverse the change

++++++ actually 8 looks pretty reasonable, still it is a bit overboard (e.g. 11182 dorsal) but still the best so far.
also better than old solution (a) ++++++++

###############################################################################

change e: finetuning of parameters

1 w/o any dilation of the ribbon mask
-> definitely better

#############################################################################

f any (+ cleaning up workflow)

1 dilation to 0 masking in ants, recip
-> really weird, stretches out somewhere


2 dil back to 3
-> really deformed, if i am right the only difference to c8, where it kind of worked
is the inversion (i.e. background = 0)

3 try mask in epi space for both images in ants

###############################################################################################

g testing bsplinesyn

1 changing to bpslinesyn with parameters as described in paper
(also replacing file_to_list)
-> this is less extreme compared to the old approach (a) but it also recovers less. 
-> maybe try this without any masking?

2 like 1 but without any masking
-> too big, cerebellum/brain stem screwed

3 like 1 but with recip
-> this stretches out more than 1, but not very favourable (in the middle)

4 like 3 but with tighter mask dil0
-> not soo bad, recovers not too nice but good in terms of borders
-> cc doesn't look good

########################################################################
h aparc+aseg

didn't work

############################

i include affine step again
-> affine doesn't look good, nonlinear even worse, very big


#########################################################################
j masking twice as suggested in forum
1 dil 3 intersect with fov for masking in ants (both), dil3 ero3 for masking anatomy before
-> promising? but actually a bit too small now, ventricles compressed, try dilating the mask even more for usage in ants
-> images don't totally fit. --> problem in nipype?!

2 dilating ants mask by 10, calculating tight mask directly from ribbon
-> should probably dilate and erode in steps, looks a bit edgy
-> this looks great!  NO IT DOESNT
- maybe still a bit too much in the center, problems in cerebellum/brainstem, etc. but still!

3 try with alternative inversion (recip)
-> even better (borders and gyri etc match much better) STILL NOT GOOD
-> but problems with cerebellum 
-> AND: problem with posterior part of cc and veins -> stretches too much now, not with other inversion. (probably try less dilation) 
-> AND: problems where EPI doesn't cover anatomy (probably mask this out in tight mask?)

4 try orginal inversion but masking afterwards
-> really really good. NO!
-> only things: 
-> cerebellum/brain stem: try less dilation
-> still a bit peculiar at FOV border: intersect fov with tight mask
-> values of inverted brain very high, think about masking-inversion-remasking?

5 reducing dilation back to 3
(and trying to fix ants apply problem)
-> better
-> fov still a problem
-> cerebellum/brainstem still a problem where in dil3 mask
-> temporal lobes a problem where hardly in mask
-> would need larger mask but then tight mask for whole brain

6 intersecting both the tight and the dilated mask with the fov
-> doesn't seem to change anything
-> problems of weird distortion near that border remain
-> this is really only for the case where the epi doesn't cover the full anatomy, otherwise looks good

7 inversion back to epi -r instead of -R
(probably nothing to do with this, just so)
-> doesn't change. keep and change in master

8 restrict to phase encoding direction
-> no too much difference, maybe stick with it since it is theoretically cleaner
******* actually makes undesirable deformations in axial view worse, UNDO in 10 **********

9 erode fov by 3 for the tight mask to keep borders, then dilate whole intersect
-> erode doesn't work
 
9 new: use mcflirt mean which is already missing a slice
-> still not, think about this again
-> has been fixed in nipype, try with var image

10 back to not restrict completely to phase encoding, for fov, use var image which should be clipped
-> doesn't work , mask isn't clipped, despite image is (probably just has a zero line)

11 integrate clip
-> helps

12 clip by 2
-> changes in unclipped images also, stick with 1


13 restrict to phase encoding direction - again, sampling none
-> that actually helps with the excessive deformation in posterior parts of 0144

14 gradient step to 0.5 -> overwritten (see below)
-> much worse

13a only sampling to none, no restriction
-> no that isnt it

14 clip back to 1, phase encoding restricted, sampling to none, radius to 10
-> no

################################################################################
k different options starting from fixed masking

1 fewer iterations : 20:10 (and undo j9)
-> didn't help with the clipping problem
-> very little difference
UNDO

2 bspline syn
-> a bit too constrained, doesn't mess up so much but doesn't help so much either

3 bspline syn try more iterations and levels, shrink and smoothing as in paper
-> gets a bit better but not fully there as with syn (for 144)
-> actually it seems pretty good for 0109 and elevating the clipping problem
-> maybe this is less sensitiv to masking, then i could use a bigger mask, maybe just skull stripping? 
(because as with syn there are still problems in the back where it deforms despite there shouldn't even really be
distortions, the epi is a bit bigger after all, maybe segmentation including csf?)

4 bspline syn with less regularisation: reduce spline distance to 16
-> this was actually more regularisation ?! 
-> also i don't like it too much in posterior parts

******* UNDO restrict def to phase encoding (some deformation in other directions seems to alleviate weird def)

5 bspline with distance 40 and undo phase encoding restriction
-> no, this deforms too much 

###########################################

l mattes
1 no inversion, simple mattes, bin 32, syn 0.1 all other equal
-> no no

###########################################
m synparameters

1 more smoothing (3,2)
-> interesting, maybe better? at least less deformation in post parts
->  no actually for 144 it makes it much worse, bigger

2 even more smoothing (6,3)
-> ridiculous

3 no smoothing (0,0)
-> little difference, maybe a bit better

4 no smoothing (0,0) and more shrinkage (4,2)
no!

5 no smoothing, shrinkage (1,1)
-> this is better in a way but also doesn't achieve full coverage in the front

6 same but with radius 1
-> even less coverage

7 same but with radius 10
-> do think this is better, less extreme but still covering
-> maybe also worse for 1128: weird twist of cerebellum

8 like 7 but with restriction to phase encoding
-> i would say better, a little bit worse with the latching to the EPI border, that needs to be fixed still

9 like 8 but 0.1 and no sampling strategy
-> little difference, maybe a bit better, but also longer i think
-> in 1128: less extreme but tendency to less coverage

10 only one level
-> basically no change
-> 1128 maybe little less extreme, little less coverage?

11 changing update field sigma to 0
-> now it doesn't change much to linear (interrupted)

12 changing update field sigma to 10
-> not good, less coverage

13 radius back to 6 (update field sigma 3)
little change

14 radius back to 4
-> not it covers even less! why? no
-> a bit better?

15 radius 4 and back to 2 levels 
-> bit better

16 less restriction again

---> smoothing 1/0, shrinkage 2/1, radius 4 quite ok


###########################################
n segmentation

n1 the bigger mask only has the effect from before -> latching to the borders. 
maybe try again when contrast problem is solved


###########################################
o contrast

1 z score epi for more comparable contrast inside/outside
-> not soo good

2 z score anat too
-> this might be good, but now it is not really enough

3  like 2 but radius 4
******caution, was still on radius 10!!!*******
-> not very pretty

4 inversion by just -1 after zscoring, then remasking
intersting, can't really tell the outcome, seems less extreme sometimes and less sensitive to the tight mask,
but then with the vein more distortion again in 1128 (latches MORE to the mask), not so much in 144, in 0190 i actually find the vein better here
possibly this makes the outer mask influence the result more

109:wird weniger hinten eingesogen, vene kippt auch, aber weniger extrem, 
axial ist das biegen der gyri am rand evtl schlimmer
brain stem besser
clipped part besser
temporal lobes besser

1128 vielleicht auch besser, vene nicht so schön, aber vorher eigentlich auch nicht perfekt


5 raise values to be positive again
-> no difference

6 no masking of anat within ants
-> no

7 dil tight mask by 1, dil mask by 5
-> no

8 tight mask not dilated, dil mask by 5
-> little diff, maybe a bit smaller

9 by 20
-> no

10 dil0/1
->no


p contrast and automask

1 automask epi before zscoring and apply dilated automask in ants

2 remask after z scoring
-> interesting, try applying deformation
-> no, almost no recovery, weird distortions inside
